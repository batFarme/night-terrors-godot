MAP SYSTEM
	map system relies upon a base and layout. the base is the map base (think a gmod map) and then 
	a layout (think props spawned in that gmod map). generally the map base has solid geometry and 
	the layout has platforms and enemy spawners, though this isn't really set in stone.
	
	map_entity has references to the current and next base, and the current and next layout. these
	are then loaded into base_theros and base_kheimon, and layout_apollo and layout_selene (which are 
	named  after the greek gods of summer and winter, and of day and night; the layouts are going to 
	be switching more often than the bases, so i thought internal names that mirror that would be cute) 
	when the game scene is first loaded in, map_entity picks two random bases and two random layouts 
	and assigns them to the current and next base and layout variables. all four are loaded in, but
	the next base and layout are down below the camera. 
	
	masterScript, a script tied to prototype_environment (should probably change the name? but 
	theres no real point to, so :shrug:) asks map_entity to spawn in a wave, and passes two 
	arguments: numberToSpawn and enemiesToSpawn.
